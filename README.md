🚗 Body Control Module using CAN Protocol (ARM LPC2129)
📌 Overview
This project implements a **Body Control Module (BCM)** using the **CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol** on the **LPC2129 ARM microcontroller**.
The system simulates automotive control functions where a **master (transmitter node)** sends commands to multiple **slave nodes (LED, Buzzer, Wiper)** via CAN communication.

⚙️ Features

* CAN-based communication between multiple nodes
* Distributed control system architecture
* Real-time switching using push buttons
* LCD interface for system status display
* Independent node operation (LED, Buzzer, Wiper)
* Efficient message-based control using CAN IDs

🧠 System Architecture
🔹 Transmitter Node (Master)
* Reads input from switches
* Sends CAN messages with specific IDs
* Displays ON/OFF status on LCD

🔹 Receiver Nodes (Slaves)
Each node listens for a specific CAN message ID:

| Node   | CAN ID | Function       |
| ------ | ------ | -------------- |
| LED    | 0x150  | Toggle LED     |
| Buzzer | 0x250  | Control buzzer |
| Wiper  | 0x350  | Control motor  |

 🔄 Working Principle

1. System initializes LCD and CAN module
2. Displays menu:
    LED   BUZZER  WIPER
3. When a switch is pressed:
   * A CAN message is created with unique ID
   * Data (0/1) represents ON/OFF state
   * Message is transmitted over CAN bus
4. Receiver node:
   * Reads CAN message
   * Matches ID
   * Performs action (ON/OFF device)

🧩 Hardware Components

* LPC2129 ARM Microcontroller
* CAN Transceiver (e.g., MCP2551)
* LCD Display (16x2)
* Push Buttons (3 switches)
* LED
* Buzzer
* Wiper Motor (or DC motor)
* Power Supply

💻 Software & Tools

* Embedded C
* Keil µVision IDE
* Flash Magic
